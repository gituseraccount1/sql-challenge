# sql-challenge

We are conducting a research project about people whom Pewlett Hackard employed during 1980s and 1990s from six remaining CVS files.

Part 1 and 2 of the challenge is in the Data_Modeling_and_Data_Engineering folder and the last part is in the Data_Anaylsis folder.

When you run the Table_Schemata.sql file in the Data_Anaylsis folder please following these instructions:
1. Create the tables first
2. Export the CVS files accordingly to the tables
3. Lastly run the foreign keys (right below the last CREATE TABLE)

I worked very hard on this yesterday evening and completed the challenge, took a break and my PgAdmin 4 froze. Unforteanly I did not save any of the code so I had to start from scratch again on Part 3. I learned my lesson.
